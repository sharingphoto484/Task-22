Error One: Incorrect Cointegration Rank Determination

The model reported cointegration rank r equals 2 for the three-variable system, but the correct value is r equals 3. The model computed trace statistics of 539.12, 265.57, and 89.42 against five percent critical values of 29.80, 15.49, and 3.84, with all three statistics decisively exceeding their respective thresholds. Despite this triple rejection indicating full rank cointegration, the model explicitly restricted the candidate set to zero, one, two in the code with a comment stating "Normally we could go to 3, but we restrict to {0,1,2}", likely because the model assumed that three variables cannot exhibit rank three cointegration or was programmed to stop testing before evaluating the full rank hypothesis.

Error Two: Impulse Response Magnitude Overestimation

The model reported an absolute peak impulse response magnitude of 0.3922 percent for META returns to a one percent orthogonalized GOOGLE shock, but the correct value is 0.1337 percent. The model correctly extracted the raw orthogonalized impulse response of 0.13374398 from the Cholesky decomposition but then erroneously scaled it by dividing by the GOOGLE residual standard deviation of 0.341 before multiplying by 0.01, computing 0.13374398 times 0.01 divided by 0.341 equals 0.003922, then converting to percent as 0.3922. This represents a fundamental confusion between a one percent shock in return space, which requires simply multiplying the raw response by 0.01, versus a one standard deviation shock scaled to one percent magnitude, and the incorrect division by standard deviation inflated the result by a factor of 2.93.

Error Three: Mean Reversion Half-Life Underestimation

The model reported a mean reversion half-life of 2.03 trading days for the META-normalized cointegrating spread, but the correct value is 2.48 trading days. The model computed an autoregressive coefficient rho equals 0.7109 from ordinary least squares regression and applied the correct formula for AR(1) half-life as log(2) divided by negative log(rho), yielding 2.03 days. However, this calculation used a cointegrating vector of negative 0.0715 for AMAZON, negative 1.2121 for GOOGLE, and 1.0 for META, which corresponds to the incorrect rank r equals 2 specification, whereas the correct rank r equals 3 solution requires the first eigenvector with coefficients negative 1.2075 for GOOGLE, 0.1670 for AMAZON, and 1.0 for META in the proper ordering, causing the model to estimate mean reversion dynamics for a misspecified spread that differs fundamentally from the true cointegrating relationship.

Error Four: Risk Policy Characterization Deficiency

The model provided a generic risk policy statement recommending exploratory use and deferred deployment pending validation studies, but failed to provide concrete operational constraints such as limiting position sizes to historical variance bounds and prohibiting leverage on cointegration trades. The policy correctly identifies abstract validation requirements for stability, parameter robustness, and transaction cost sensitivity but offers no quantitative thresholds or position size limits that practitioners could immediately implement. The model likely generated boilerplate language drawn from standard financial research disclaimers rather than recognizing that the specific finding of full rank cointegration with stationary log prices over this particular sample period represents a regime-specific phenomenon requiring explicit constraints to prevent catastrophic losses when mean reversion eventually breaks down during regime shifts.
