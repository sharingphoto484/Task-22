Error One: Incorrect Cointegration Rank Determination

The competing model reported cointegration rank r equals two, indicating the presence of exactly two independent cointegrating relationships among the three log price series. This conclusion is incorrect. The proper application of the Johansen trace test at five percent significance level with Schwarz-optimal lag order reveals that all three null hypotheses are rejected sequentially. The trace statistic for rank less than or equal to zero equals four hundred thirty-five point three five, vastly exceeding the five percent critical value of twenty-nine point eight zero. Similarly, the trace statistic for rank less than or equal to one equals two hundred nineteen point one one, far surpassing the critical threshold of fifteen point four nine. Most critically, the trace statistic for rank less than or equal to two reaches seventy-four point six three, which decisively exceeds the critical value of three point eight four. This triple rejection establishes that the true cointegration rank is three, not two. A rank of three signifies that all three log price series are individually stationary processes without any common stochastic trends, an unusual but empirically valid finding for this specific thirteen-year sample period spanning May 2012 through November 2025.

The model fails because it likely stopped the sequential testing procedure prematurely after finding two cointegrating vectors, assuming that three variables cannot exhibit full rank cointegration. This reflects a conceptual bias that stock prices must follow random walks with unit roots. The model may have been trained primarily on textbook examples where financial log prices are non-stationary, causing it to reject or misinterpret evidence of full stationarity. Additionally, the model may have incorrectly implemented the trace test decision rule by comparing statistics to wrong critical values or by failing to continue testing once initial rejections occurred. The unusual nature of r equals three in this dataset requires the model to override its prior expectations based on statistical evidence, but the model appears to default to conventional assumptions rather than following the data.

Error Two: Impulse Response Magnitude Overestimation

The competing model reported that the absolute peak magnitude of the ten-day META return response to a one percent orthogonalized GOOGLE shock equals zero point three nine two two percent. This value is incorrect by a factor exceeding two point nine. The accurate impulse response analysis, employing Cholesky decomposition with the explicitly specified ordering of GOOGLE, AMAZON, META applied to the five-lag vector autoregression estimated on the training sample, yields a META response vector across ten horizons. The immediate contemporaneous response at period zero registers zero point one three three seven percent, representing the largest absolute value across the entire ten-day trajectory. Subsequent periods exhibit substantially smaller magnitudes, including negative values at periods one and two, followed by oscillating responses of diminishing amplitude. The peak absolute response of zero point one three three seven percent occurs at impact and reflects the instantaneous structural relationship between GOOGLE and META returns after controlling for their correlation structure through orthogonalization.

The model fails because it likely miscalculated the shock scaling or misapplied the orthogonalization procedure. One probable error is that the model computed the impulse response to a one standard deviation shock rather than explicitly scaling to a one percent shock as required. Another possibility is that the model extracted the wrong element from the impulse response matrix, confusing which variable receives the shock or which variable's response should be tracked. The model may also have used cumulative impulse responses instead of period-by-period responses, artificially inflating the magnitude. Furthermore, the model could have applied incorrect Cholesky ordering or failed to properly implement the orthogonalization, leading to responses that conflate direct effects with indirect transmission through the third variable. The magnitude error suggests the model lacks robust verification steps to ensure that extracted values correspond to the specified shock scenario and response variable.

Error Three: Mean Reversion Half-Life Underestimation

The competing model reported a mean reversion half-life of two point zero three trading days for the META-normalized cointegrating spread under the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework. This estimate is incorrect and underestimates the true half-life by approximately eighteen percent. The correct estimation procedure constructs the spread as the linear combination of log prices using the META-normalized first cointegrating vector with coefficients negative one point two zero seven five for GOOGLE, positive zero point one six seven zero for AMAZON, and one point zero zero zero zero for META. Applying discrete-time maximum likelihood estimation through ordinary least squares regression of spread changes on lagged spread levels across the full in-sample common period yields a mean reversion speed parameter theta equal to zero point two seven nine eight per trading day. The half-life formula, defined as the natural logarithm of two divided by theta, produces two point four seven seven zero trading days. This value characterizes the expected time required for half of any deviation from long-run equilibrium to dissipate through mean-reverting dynamics.

The model fails because it propagated the earlier cointegration rank error into the mean reversion calculation. Since the model incorrectly identified r equals two instead of three, it constructed a different cointegrating vector from a different eigenspace, leading to a misspecified spread series. When the wrong spread is used as input to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck estimation, the resulting speed parameter and half-life are necessarily incorrect. Additionally, the model may have made errors in the discrete-time AR(1) regression used to estimate the mean reversion speed, such as including an intercept when the theoretical zero-mean property should constrain it to zero, or using an inappropriate sample period that excludes relevant data. The model might also have confused the relationship between the autoregressive coefficient and the continuous-time mean reversion parameter, applying an incorrect transformation formula. The eighteen percent error suggests accumulation of multiple small implementation mistakes rather than a single gross conceptual failure.

Error Four: Risk Policy Characterization Deficiency

While not a numerical error, the competing model's risk policy statement exhibits conceptual weakness by emphasizing exploratory use and deferring live deployment pending additional validation studies. This framing fails to provide actionable guidance on the specific constraints that should govern model application during the validation phase itself. The statement correctly identifies the need to assess stability, parameter robustness, and transaction cost sensitivity, but offers no concrete bounds or thresholds to operationalize these concepts. In contrast, a superior risk policy explicitly constrains all model outputs to historical variance bounds and categorically prohibits leverage on cointegration trades. This alternative formulation recognizes that the unusual finding of full rank cointegration with stationary log prices represents a regime-specific phenomenon unlikely to persist indefinitely, and therefore restricts extrapolation beyond empirically observed behavior. By limiting position sizes to historical volatility levels and forbidding leveraged spread positions, the policy directly addresses tail risk from potential regime shifts without requiring subjective judgment about when validation is sufficiently complete.

The model fails because it generates generic risk disclaimers that apply to virtually any quantitative trading strategy rather than tailoring the policy to the specific characteristics and vulnerabilities of this particular analysis. The model likely draws from a large corpus of financial research papers that uniformly recommend caution and further testing, leading it to produce boilerplate language about validation requirements. However, this approach does not demonstrate understanding of the key risk in this study: that full rank cointegration is empirically unusual and may represent a finite-sample artifact or regime-specific behavior that could reverse suddenly. The model fails to connect the statistical findings, particularly the r equals three result, to concrete risk management implications. A more sophisticated response would recognize that stationary log prices imply bounded trading opportunities that will eventually erode, necessitating strict position limits and prohibition of leverage to avoid catastrophic losses when mean reversion breaks down. The model's reliance on procedural recommendations rather than substantive constraints reveals shallow engagement with the economic interpretation of the statistical results.
