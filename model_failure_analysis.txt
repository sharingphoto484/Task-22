Error One: Incorrect Cointegration Rank Determination

The model reported cointegration rank r equals 2 for the three-variable system. The correct value is r equals 3. The model explicitly restricted the sequential trace test candidate set to {0, 1, 2} with a hardcoded comment "Normally we could go to 3, but we restrict to {0,1,2}" despite computing trace statistics of 539.12, 265.57, and 89.42 that all decisively exceeded their five percent critical values of 29.80, 15.49, and 3.84. The testing procedure stopped before evaluating the full rank hypothesis due to an assumption that three variables cannot exhibit rank three cointegration, reflecting a conceptual bias that stock log prices must follow random walks with unit roots rather than following the statistical evidence of full stationarity.

Error Two: Impulse Response Magnitude Overestimation

The model reported an absolute peak impulse response magnitude of 0.3922 percent for META returns to a one percent orthogonalized GOOGLE shock. The correct value is 0.1337 percent. The model incorrectly scaled the raw orthogonalized response of 0.13374398 by dividing by the GOOGLE residual standard deviation of 0.341 before multiplying by 0.01, computing (0.13374398 × 0.01 / 0.341) × 100 equals 0.3922 percent. A one percent shock in return space requires simply multiplying the raw orthogonalized response by 0.01 without any standard deviation adjustment, but the model confused a one percent absolute shock with a one standard deviation shock scaled to one percent magnitude, causing the result to be inflated by a factor of 2.93.

Error Three: Mean Reversion Half-Life Underestimation

The model reported a mean reversion half-life of 2.03 trading days for the META-normalized cointegrating spread. The correct value is 2.48 trading days. The model propagated the earlier rank misspecification by constructing the spread using a cointegrating vector of [-0.0715, -1.2121, 1.0] for [AMZN, GOOG, META] from the rank r equals 2 solution, then estimating an autoregressive coefficient rho equals 0.7109 and computing log(2) / (-log(0.7109)) equals 2.03. The correct rank r equals 3 solution requires the first eigenvector with coefficients [-1.2075, 0.1670, 1.0] for [GOOG, AMZN, META] that yields a fundamentally different spread series and different mean reversion dynamics, demonstrating how the initial rank error cascaded through subsequent analysis steps.

Error Four: Risk Policy Characterization Deficiency

The model provided a generic risk policy statement recommending "Position sizing and model use should remain strictly exploratory, with no live capital deployment until stability, parameter robustness, and transaction-cost sensitivity have been independently validated". This fails to provide concrete operational constraints such as limiting position sizes to historical variance bounds and categorically prohibiting leverage on cointegration trades. The model generated boilerplate language drawn from standard financial research disclaimers about validation requirements rather than connecting the specific statistical finding of full rank cointegration with r equals 3 to the substantive risk that stationary log prices represent. A superior policy would recognize that stationary log prices are a regime-specific phenomenon requiring explicit position limits to prevent catastrophic losses when mean reversion eventually breaks down during regime shifts.
