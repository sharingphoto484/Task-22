Error One: Incorrect Cointegration Rank Determination

The model reported cointegration rank r equals 2 for the three-variable system, but the correct value is r equals 3, likely because the model explicitly restricted the sequential trace test candidate set to {0, 1, 2} with a hardcoded comment "Normally we could go to 3, but we restrict to {0,1,2}" despite computing trace statistics of 539.12, 265.57, and 89.42 that all decisively exceeded their five percent critical values of 29.80, 15.49, and 3.84, stopping the testing procedure before evaluating the full rank hypothesis due to an assumption that three variables cannot exhibit rank three cointegration.

Error Two: Impulse Response Magnitude Overestimation

The model reported an absolute peak impulse response magnitude of 0.3922 percent for META returns to a one percent orthogonalized GOOGLE shock, but the correct value is 0.1337 percent, likely because the model incorrectly scaled the raw orthogonalized response of 0.13374398 by dividing by the GOOGLE residual standard deviation of 0.341 before multiplying by 0.01, computing (0.13374398 × 0.01 / 0.341) × 100 equals 0.3922 percent, when a one percent shock in return space requires simply multiplying the raw response by 0.01 without any standard deviation adjustment, confusing a one percent absolute shock with a one standard deviation shock scaled to one percent magnitude.

Error Three: Mean Reversion Half-Life Underestimation

The model reported a mean reversion half-life of 2.03 trading days for the META-normalized cointegrating spread, but the correct value is 2.48 trading days, likely because the model propagated the earlier rank misspecification by constructing the spread using a cointegrating vector of [-0.0715, -1.2121, 1.0] for [AMZN, GOOG, META] from the rank r equals 2 solution, then estimating an autoregressive coefficient rho equals 0.7109 and computing log(2) / (-log(0.7109)) equals 2.03, whereas the correct rank r equals 3 solution requires the first eigenvector with coefficients [-1.2075, 0.1670, 1.0] for [GOOG, AMZN, META] that yields a different spread series and different mean reversion dynamics.

Error Four: Risk Policy Characterization Deficiency

The model provided a generic risk policy statement recommending "Position sizing and model use should remain strictly exploratory, with no live capital deployment until stability, parameter robustness, and transaction-cost sensitivity have been independently validated", but this fails to provide concrete operational constraints such as limiting position sizes to historical variance bounds and categorically prohibiting leverage on cointegration trades, likely because the model generated boilerplate language drawn from standard financial research disclaimers about validation requirements rather than connecting the specific statistical finding of full rank cointegration with r equals 3 to the substantive risk that stationary log prices represent a regime-specific phenomenon requiring explicit position limits to prevent catastrophic losses when mean reversion eventually breaks down during regime shifts.
