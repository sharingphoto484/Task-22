Error One: Incorrect Cointegration Rank Determination

The model reported cointegration rank r equals 2 for the three-variable system, but the correct value is r equals 3, likely because the model stopped the sequential Johansen trace test prematurely after finding two cointegrating vectors, assuming that stock log prices cannot exhibit full rank cointegration, or because the model incorrectly compared the third trace statistic of 74.63 against the wrong critical value instead of the correct five percent threshold of 3.84.

Error Two: Impulse Response Magnitude Overestimation

The model reported an absolute peak impulse response magnitude of 0.3922 percent for META returns to a one percent orthogonalized GOOGLE shock, but the correct value is 0.1337 percent, likely because the model computed the response to a one standard deviation shock rather than explicitly scaling to one percent as specified, or because the model extracted the wrong element from the impulse response matrix by confusing the response variable or cumulating responses across periods instead of taking period-by-period values.

Error Three: Mean Reversion Half-Life Underestimation

The model reported a mean reversion half-life of 2.03 trading days for the META-normalized cointegrating spread, but the correct value is 2.48 trading days, likely because the model propagated the earlier cointegration rank error forward by constructing the spread from a different eigenvector corresponding to r equals 2 instead of using the first eigenvector from the r equals 3 solution, or because the model made errors in the discrete-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck regression by including an inappropriate intercept term or applying an incorrect transformation between the autoregressive coefficient and the continuous-time mean reversion speed parameter.

Error Four: Risk Policy Characterization Deficiency

The model provided a generic risk policy statement recommending exploratory use and deferred deployment pending validation studies, but failed to provide concrete operational constraints such as limiting position sizes to historical variance bounds and prohibiting leverage on cointegration trades, likely because the model generated boilerplate language drawn from generic financial research disclaimers rather than connecting the specific statistical finding of full rank cointegration with r equals 3 to the substantive risk that stationary log prices represent a regime-specific phenomenon requiring strict position limits to avoid catastrophic losses when mean reversion eventually breaks down.
