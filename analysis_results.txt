DISCUSSION
==========================================

Performance Synergies Between Clock Speed and Memory Bandwidth:

The interaction coefficient of 0.7020 between ClockSpeed and
MemoryBandwidth reveals important performance synergies in processor architecture.
This positive interaction suggests that increases in clock speed yield progressively
greater performance gains when paired with higher memory bandwidth, indicating that
these two specifications work multiplicatively rather than additively. Processors
with both high clock speeds and substantial memory bandwidth can process instructions
faster while simultaneously accessing data more efficiently, creating a synergistic
effect that amplifies overall performance beyond what would be expected from the
individual contributions of each component alone.
