DISCUSSION: How Observed Changes in Happiness Scores Reflect Cultural Transformations
==========================================================================================


The observed changes in happiness scores between 2017 and 2019 reflect subtle but significant
cultural transformations occurring globally. The mean annual percentage change of 0.835% suggests
a relatively stable global well-being landscape, yet beneath this stability lie shifting priorities
in how societies conceptualize and pursue happiness. The strong predictive power of social support
and healthy life expectancy, alongside GDP per capita, indicates a cultural evolution beyond purely
materialistic definitions of well-being toward more holistic, community-oriented values. This
transformation is particularly evident in the consistent correlation between GDP and happiness
across all three years (r ≈ 0.807), suggesting that while economic prosperity remains foundational,
its relationship with happiness is mediated increasingly by social and health factors. The variance
in freedom to make life choices (0.0210) across nations in 2019 highlights divergent cultural
trajectories, where some societies prioritize individual autonomy while others maintain collectivist
frameworks, both valid pathways to well-being within their cultural contexts.
